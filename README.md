# Project1:EDA on retail sales data using Python

# Conclusion :
The analysis shows that customers from all age groups make purchases, but most buyers are middle-aged (40–60 years). The number of items bought per transaction is almost equal for quantities 1 to 4, showing consistent buying behavior. Overall, the business has a balanced customers and steady sales pattern. These insights can help plan better marketing strategies and product offers to attract more customers and increase sales.  


# Project2:EDA on McDonald's Menu using Python

# Insights : 
1. Most menu items are from the Coffee & Tea category and Breakfast and Chicken & Fish have the highest calorie density.
2. Calories are highly correlated with Total Fat and Sodium and Items range from 0 to 1880 calories, average 370.
3. Drinks like Diet Coke contribute zero calories and Large portion items inflate calorie and sodium content.

# Project4: Predicting house price with linear regression
Tech stack: Python EDA,Linear regession (ML)

# Conclusion:
The Linear Regression model provides a good starting point for predicting house prices using demographic and location features.
Median Income is the most important predictor of housing prices.


# Project5:Analyzing Google Playstore data 

# conclusion:

Data cleaning :
Missing values in the apps dataset were handled by imputing numerical columns (Rating, Size_MB) 
with category-wise means and medians.  
Version columns (Current Ver, Android Ver) were filled with 'Unknown' to maintain completeness.  
In the user_reviews dataset, over 26,000 entries had no review text or sentiment. 
These were labeled as 'Unknown' to differentiate between “no data” and actual neutral sentiment.
